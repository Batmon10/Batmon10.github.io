Customized for Dhruval Patel on 2025-09-07 22:01 UTC.

What I changed:
- Page <title> now "Dhruval Patel | Portfolio".
- Fixed CSS and JS includes in index.html so the site actually loads styles and scripts.
- Replaced "Alexa" naming with "Dhruval" where present.
- Updated resume link to assets/pdf/Dhruval-Resume.pdf (renamed from Alexa-Cv.pdf).
- Updated text content placeholders in "Text Portfolio Alexa.txt" with your details: role, tagline, location, university, and social links (placeholders).

What you should update next:
- Replace email in contact forms and any mailto: with your real email: dhruvalpatel@example.com
- Edit social links in "Text Portfolio Alexa.txt" and index.html to your actual profiles.
- Swap images in assets/img/ with your own (perfil.png, about.jpg, portfolio images).
- If you have a real resume, replace assets/pdf/Dhruval-Resume.pdf with your PDF.
- Tweak colors in assets/css/styles.css by setting --hue-color.
